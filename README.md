# Credit Card Approval Prediction (Machine Learning)

## Overview
This project predicts whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details.  
It uses machine learning classification techniques to assist financial institutions in automating and improving decision-making accuracy.

## Problem Statement
Manual credit card approval processes are time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project aims to build a predictive model that can automatically determine approval eligibility using historical applicant data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains applicant information such as:
- Income
- Employment status
- Credit history
- Personal and financial attributes  

(Target variable: Approval status)

## Approach
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature encoding and scaling  
4. Model training using classification algorithms  
5. Model evaluation and prediction  

## Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression (classification)
- Evaluated using accuracy and prediction probabilities

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Results
The model successfully predicts credit card approval status with good accuracy and provides probability-based decisions.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `final_credit_card_project.ipynb`
2. Run all cells sequentially in Google Colab
3. Ensure the dataset file is available in the working directory

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world financial decision-making problems by automating credit approval predictions efficiently and reliably.
